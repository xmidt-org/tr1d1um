  # Defaults to 'false'.
  disablePartnerIDs: false

  # validation provides options for validating the webhook's URL and TTL 
  # related fields. Some validation happens regardless of the configuration: 
  # URLs must be a valid URL structure, the Matcher.DeviceID values must 
  # compile into regular expressions, and the Events field must have at
