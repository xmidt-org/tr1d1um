# webhook provides configuration for storing and obtaining webhook

# Optional: if key is not supplied, webhooks would be disabled.
webhook:

  # disablePartnerIDs, if true, will allow webhooks to register without 
  # checking the validity of the partnerIDs in the request
  # Defaults to 'false'.
  disablePartnerIDs: false

  # validation provides options for validating the webhook's URL and TTL 
  # related fields. Some validation happens regardless of the configuration: 
  # URLs must be a valid URL structure, the Matcher.DeviceID values must 
  # compile into regular expressions, and the Events field must have at 
  # least one value and all values must compile into regular expressions. 
  validation:

    # url provides options for additional validation of the webhook's 
    # Config.URL, FailureURL, and Config.AlternativeURLs fields.

      # httpsOnly will allow only URLs with https schemes through if true.
      # (Optional). Defaults to 'false'.
      httpsOnly: false

      # allowLoopback will allow any canonical or IP loopback address if 
      # true. Otherwise, loopback addresses are considered invalid.
      # (Optional). Defaults to 'false'.
      allowLoopback: true

      # allowIP allows the different webhook URLs to have IP hostnames if set to true.
      # (Optional). Defaults to 'false'.
      allowIP: true

      # allowSpecialUseHosts allows URLs that include reserved domains if set to true.  
      # Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain#Reserved_domains
      # (Optional). Defaults to 'false'.
      allowSpecialUseHosts: true

      # allowSpecialUseIPs, if set to true, allows URLs that contain or route to IPs that have 
      # been marked as reserved through various RFCs: rfc6761, rfc6890, rfc8190.
      # (Optional). Defaults to 'false'.
      allowSpecialUseIPs: true

      # invalidHosts is a slice that contains strings that we do not want

      # invalidSubnets is a list of IP subnets.  If a URL contains an

      # (Optional). Defaults to an empty slice.
      invalidSubnets: []

    # ttl provides information for what is considered valid for time-related 
    # fields (Duration and Until) in the webhook.  A webhook set to expire 
    # too far in the future is considered invalid, while a time in the past 
    # is considered equivalent to a request to delete the webhook.  
    # Regardless of this configuration, either Until or Duration must have a 
    # non-zero value.
    ttl:
      # max is the length of time a webhook is allowed to live.  The Duration 
      # cannot be larger than this value, and the Until value cannot be set 
      # later than the current time + max + jitter.
      max: 1m

      # jitter is the buffer time added when checking that the Until value is 
      # valid.  If there is a slight clock skew between servers or some delay 
      # in the http request, jitter should help account for that when ensuring 
      # that Until is not a time too far in the future.
      jitter: 10s

  # JWTParserType establishes which parser type will be used by the JWT token
  # acquirer used by Argus. Options include 'simple' and 'raw'.

# capabilityCheck provides the details needed for checking an incoming JWT's
# capabilities.  If the type of check isn't provided, no checking is done.  The
